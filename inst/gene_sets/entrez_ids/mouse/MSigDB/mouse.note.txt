Mouse gene sets were downloaded from http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/MSigDB/
on 20160809:

   h: hallmark gene sets               (  50 total)
  c2: curated gene sets                (4726 total)
  c3: motif gene sets                  ( 836 total)
  c4: computational gene sets          ( 858 total)
  c6: oncogenic signatures gene sets   ( 189 total)
  c7: immunologic signatures gene sets (4872 total)

WEHI Procedure:
The current MSigDB v5.1 xml file was downloaded.
Human Entrez Gene IDs were mapped to Mouse Entrez Gene IDs, using the HGNC Comparison 
of Orthology Predictions (HCOP) (downloaded 9 May 2016).
Each collection was converted to a list in R, and written to a RData file using 
save().
